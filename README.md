# Parameter-free Online Linear Optimization with Side Information via Universal Coin Betting


## Requirements
The experiments were run under the following environment:
```text
python==3.8.1
matplotlib==3.3.4
numpy==1.20.0
pandas==1.2.1
py-cpuinfo==7.0.0
scikit-learn==0.24.1
scipy==1.6.0
```

## Datasets
- The datasets `['BeijingPM2pt5', 'MetroInterstateTrafficVolume']` are included in the repository.

## To replicate
- First, run `exp-scripts.ipynb` for each dataset. 
  (This step can be skipped since the saved variables are also included in the repository for convenience.)
- Then, run `generate-plots.ipynb` to generate summary plots.
